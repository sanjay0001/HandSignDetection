## Introduction

Communication can be defined as the act of transferring information from one place, person, or group to another. It consists of three components: the speaker, the message that is being communicated, and the listener. It can be considered successful only when whatever message the speaker is trying to convey is received and understood by the listener. It can be divided into different categories as follows : formal and informal communication, oral (face-to-face and distance) and written communication, non-verbal, grapevine, feedback, and visual communication, and the active listening.

 The formal communication (official communication) is steered through the channels that are pre-determined. The unofficial or grapevine communication is the spontaneous communication between individuals in oneâ€™s profession that does not have any formal protocol or structure. 

The oral communication (face-to-face and distance) is the communication in which words are exchanged between people who are present in front or at a distance (with the help of technology including voice and video calls, webinars, etc.). The written communication is the communication in which letters, emails, notices, or any other written form is used for communicating. The non-verbal communication is the communication that uses gestures, facial expressions, body language, etc.

 The feedback communication happens when a person gives feedback on some product or service provided by an individual or a company. The visual communication occurs when a person gets information from a visual source like televisions, social networking, or any other source. Active listening is when a person listens to and understands what the other individual is trying to convey so that the communication becomes more meaningful and effective.

Non-verbal communication helps deaf and dumb people to communicate amongst themselves and with others. Deaf is a disability that impairs a person's hearing ability and makes them incapable to hear while dumb is a disability that impairs the speaking ability and makes them incapable to speak. Not being able to speak or listen makes it difficult to establish communication with others. This is where sign languages come into the role, it enables a person to communicate without words. But a problem still exists, not many people possess the knowledge of sign language. Deaf and dumb may be able to communicate amongst themselves using sign languages but it is still difficult for them to communicate with people having normal hearing and vice-versa due to the lack of knowledge of sign languages. This issue can be resolved using a technology-driven solution. By using such a solution, one can easily translate the gestures of sign language into the commonly spoken language, English.

A lot of research has been done in this field and there is still a need for further re- search. For gesture translation, data gloves, motion capturing systems, or sensors have been used. Vision-based SLR systems have also been developed previously. The existing Indian Sign Language Recognition system was developed using machine learning algorithms with MATLAB. Authors have worked on single-handed and double- handed gestures. 

They used two algorithms to train their system, K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm and Back Propagation Algorithm. Their system achieved 93-96% accuracy. Though being highly accurate, it is not a real-time SLR system. The objective of this paper is to develop a real-time SLR system using TensorFlow object detection API and train it using a dataset that will be created using a webcam.

The rest of this paper after the introduction is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related work on the SLR system. Section 3 describes the data acquisition and generation. Section 4 focuses on the methodology of the developed system. Section 5 presents the experimental evaluation of the system, and finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with future work.
